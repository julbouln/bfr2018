Optimizations
- for zoom: uses vertex to render tile layers or uses multiple cached RenderTextures ?

Bug:
- unit looking for each other fight sometimes stuck together
- if an ennemy is in sight, unit refuse to obey
- memory leak ?

Improvements:
- improve AI expedition destination
- improve multi-agent combat
- restrict building position to visible fog

Game:
- add projectile explosion FX
- vautour FX
- add intro & credits
- add min/max attack2 distance
- add building damage level sprites : refactor AnimationHandler
- add resource trap + explosion FX
- resources should evolve with case size (4x3 replace 12 1x1 resources), add more resources (forest, etc)
  maybe some resources should be infranchissable
- ruins should be tilable ?

Interface:
- add mouse cursors
- add settings
